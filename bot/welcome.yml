    # CMC: Community Management Community

    Welcome to the CMC server, a community dedicated to helping everyone with their own community spaces. We aim to promote education through collaboration, with a distinct focus on creating resources that exist outside of Discord, and that are thus readily accessible.

    ## PluralKit

    This server makes use of <@466378653216014359>, an accessibily tool primarily designed for use by members of plural systems. While this bot will make some messages appear to have been sent by bots and break up the flow of fast-moving discussions a little, it's a necessary accessibility tool for those who need it. To learn about plural systems, we suggest reading more here: <https://moderation.wiki/a/plurality>


    **Note:** On this server, you may only use <@466378653216014359> as an accessibility tool. Don't use it to impersonate someone else, role-play, evade blocks, or otherwise cause trouble.

    ## Our Rules

    Please note that the rules below are not an exhaustive list of everything we expect from our users. Instead, you should use them to inform yourself on what types of behaviour we expect from you, and what we don't want to see happening within our community.


    The moderation team reserves the right to remove users from the CMC project and community spaces as they see fit, including based on the behaviour of a user outside of spaces they're responsible for. However, if you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to post in <#1429790752111853709> or <#1194652314275950702> (depending on your access), or send us a DM.

  rules:
    Follow Discord's Rules: >-
      We're obliged to enforce Discord's rules, as a project that mostly exists on Discord - that means that everyone must follow Discord's [Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/terms/guidelines).


      We recognise that some client mods provide useful moderation tools and accessibility features, and we don't want to tell folks what software they may or may not run on their devices. However, while Discord is not known for banning client mod users at random, you're still taking a huge risk by installing one. For that reason, we would rather not facilitate the promotion of client mods on this server. This, however, doesn't mean you need to completely avoid discussing them - sometimes they're on-topic!

    Try to Speak English: >-
      While we understand that not everyone speaks native-level English, it's the common language used in our community spaces. As a result, we are currently unable to moderate discussions that primarily use other languages.


      If you don't speak English as well as you perhaps would like to, don't worry - please give it your best shot regardless, and make use of translation tools like Google Translate if you need to. We will not tolerate discrimination towards anyone for a lack of proficiency with the English language.


      This rule only applies when it's impossible to discern the subject or primary content of a discussion due to the use of another language. It does not apply when talking about translating text, moderating content in other languages, or localising tooling, bots, or the CMC project itself.

    Interact Appropriately: >-
      Keep discussions relevant and meaningful, be conscious of other folks using the server, and do your best to adhere to the topics of the channels you're using.


      In particular:

      - Use Sapphire to create reports for the moderation team. Reports don't belong in public channels, but you may ping <@&1131362880269336616> for situations that require the immediate attention of the moderation team.

      - Don't use generative AI to answer questions, or to interact on this server in general. The use of generative AI is also prohibited when contributing content to the CMC projects. This rule exists largely because of the dangers of AI hallucinations, and we take this problem seriously.

      - Don't post NSFW media or make sexual advances or comments towards other users. Discussions about the definition of NSFW, how to handle NSFW content in your spaces, and other similar topics are allowed.

      - Don't post malicious files. Malicious links may only be posted within a `code block`, and only when they're relevant to a current discussion. We're currently working on collaborating with the FishFish project, where discussing this type of content is a little more on-topic.

      - Try to keep off-topic chatter to the dedicated off-topic channels. Each channel has a purpose, and it's important to avoid clogging up on-topic channels with chatter, as it may prevent folks from discussing something important.

      - Community management is a complex topic and many issues have multiple valid approaches. While meaningful debate is allowed and encouraged, try to avoid starting (or joining) arguments. When you feel heated, it's often best to step away and come back later. If you feel something is problematic, it's usually better to contact the moderation team rather than engaging directly.

    Respect Other Users: >-
      This server is likely to include many different types of folks from all walks of life, and it's important to treat each other with deserved respect.


      In particular:

      - Don't use this server as a way to contact any Discord staff members that may be present here, or to attempt to escalate your Discord reports or support tickets.

      - Don't harass or bully anyone, and don't discriminate against protected minority groups. Hate speech (such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc) will not be tolerated. We also don't tolerate discrimination towards plural systems based on their origins.

      - Don't doxx anyone, or otherwise share their addresses, real names, IP addresses, or any other personal information without their permission.

      - Don't abuse accessibility tools such as <@466378653216014359> by impersonating someone else, role-playing, evading blocks or otherwise causing trouble.

      - Don't harass verified members for invite codes, regardless of whether you've already been verified.

      - Don't send unsolicited private messages to other users, unless they've stated (either via their Discord profile bio or a message) that they're open to them.

      - Don't pester other users about their Discord profile badges. If you have questions about a specific badge, Discord talks about them in this article: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360035962891-Profile-Badges-101

      - If another user states that they're uncomfortable with you talking to them, stop engaging. Don't evade blocks, and don't ask anyone to pass messages to someone that doesn't want to talk to you.

      - Remember that other users may have disabilities and trauma triggers. We'd appreciate if you would add alt text to your images, avoid posting flashing or fast-moving imagery, and use spoilers with content warnings when discussing difficult subjects.

      - This project is focused on educating folks and creating resources, rather than keeping track of individual members of specific-community-focused harassment groups. Discussions relating to those groups are on-topic, but we would prefer not to orchestrate witch hunts.

      - We aim to educate on quite a few topics, and part of that work will involve experiencing others' inexperience, biases, and misconceptions first-hand. While we have no interest in judging the reactions of a minority group towards folks with harmful beliefs about them, we would still like to try to educate those who are not inherently bigoted, which may be made more difficult when basic misconceptions are met with instant hostility.

    ## Reporting, Questions & Feedback

    If you run into any problems or otherwise need to contact our staff, please pick one of these options:

    **Reporting:** You have a few options when you need to report something to the moderators:

    - You can right-click or tap-and-hold on a message or user, select "Apps", and then select Sapphire's reporting command to create a report.

    - For ongoing issues in channels that require direct moderator attention, you can ping the <@&1131362880269336616> role directly in the channel.

    - You can also DM one of our moderators or admins, if you feel that's more appropriate or comfortable.

    **Questions & Feedback**: If you just have a question or need to talk about something, we prefer these approaches:

    - Create a post in <#1429790752111853709> or <#1194652314275950702> (depending on your access) for broader discussions that should involve the community.

    - Send a DM to one of our moderators or admins for a more private discussion.

    ## Applications

    To better address our community's safety needs, we run a two-tiered access system:
    
    - The channels in the "Information", "Feeds", and "Public Channels" categories, along with any other categories starting with the ðŸ’¬ emoji, are public. Anyone who joins this server will be given access to these channels, so please keep that in mind when posting there.

    - The channels in any categories starting with the ðŸ”’ emoji are private. These channels can only be accessed by staff members, and users who have obtained an invite code and gone through the applications process.

    - The channels in any categories starting with the ðŸ”§ emoji are staff channels, and are only visible to staff members.


    **To apply for access to the private channels:** Please see <#1305111270697074728> for more information.
